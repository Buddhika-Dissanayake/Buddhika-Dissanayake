## 🧑‍🎓 About Me

I'm a **statistician** with a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and data science.  
Currently, I serve as an **Assistant Director at the Sri Lanka Planning Service**, contributing to national policy implementation and development strategy as an executive officer in the Sri Lankan government.

My academic journey began with a **Bachelor’s degree in Physics**, which led me into the **field of metrology and calibration** at the **National Metrology Institute of Sri Lanka**.  
While working in scientific instrumentation, I developed a deep interest in data and modeling, which drove me to pursue a **Master’s in Applied Statistics**, where I graduated **top of my batch**.

With a solid analytical mindset and exposure to real-world statistical applications, I’m deeply passionate about **research, statistical modeling, and using data for public impact**.
